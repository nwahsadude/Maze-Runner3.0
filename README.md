Maze-runner 

A game with no mazes but there is running. It was made to see if I could build a basic multiplayer game.

It is being upgraded to have better gameplay and player accounts.

It is using nodejs, melonjs, mongoose, socketio, passportjs.

Here is a link to it up and running http://mazerunner.beandream.com
